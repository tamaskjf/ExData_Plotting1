The *plot1.R*, the *plot2.R*, the *plot3.R* and the *plot4.R* are each downloading the above mentioned ZIP file and make a plot from two days of the data set: 01/02/2007 and 02/02/2007 and after that, saves it to a PNG file. The PNG files are also uploaded to the repository.

Please take into consideration, that the abbreviations of the days are not the same in all language, in these case:
